Setup: pip install pennylane scikit-learn matplotlib

run: python quantum_vs_classical_shapes.py


- if pennylane shows a yellow underline, then that is probably because you need a virtual enviornment, create a virtual enviornment respective to your operating system (or use what you have, I am personally using a conda enviornment),

- to change python interpreter do ctrl p this is what I do on windows or whatever it is respective to your os

- I am running this on python 3.13.5 for anyone who is curious but anything 3.11+ should work fine
